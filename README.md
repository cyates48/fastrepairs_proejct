FastRepair is an online item repair shop that allows for both customers and employers to input/check information on their respective webpages. An employer is anyone who would be working on the item.

On the customer page, you can add an item that you would like to repair, check the status for an item of yours in repair, and view the customer bill for the item once it is ready. On the employer page, you can update the status of an item (READY, DONE), review the items under repair, view the items in the repair log, and view the revenue between two certain dates.
